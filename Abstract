ChIP-seq is a method that helps scientists to understand where a particular protein or modification is located on the DNA in cells.
In this study,  ChIP-seq experiments are performed using HepG2 cells, a type of human liver cell. They used an antibody that can specifically recognize histone H3 with succinylation at position 122 and another one for HAT1.

objective:

Specific modification on a protein called histone H3, known as succinylation at position 122. The objective is to find out where on the DNA histone H3K122 succinylation is found in HepG2 cells 

 Study how this modification is related to another protein called HAT1.
